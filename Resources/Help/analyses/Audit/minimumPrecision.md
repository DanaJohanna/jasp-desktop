Obtaining a required minimum precision
==========================

The precision is the accuracy with with you estimate the population misstatement. In the statistical analysis, the precision is represented by the difference between the estimated most likely error and the upper bound on the misstatement. 

By enabling this sampling objective, you are be able to plan a sample in order to make a statement about the misstatement in the population with a required minimum precision.
