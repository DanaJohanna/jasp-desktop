Testing against a performance materiality
==========================

The performance materiality is the amount established by the auditor below the normal materiality of financial reports to decrease the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetectable misstatements exceeds the level of financial reports as a whole. In the statistical analysis, the performance materiality represents the upper bound of tolerable misstatement. 

By testing against a performance materiality, you are able to plan a sample in order to collect evidence for or against the statement that the population as a whole does not contain misstatements that are considered material (i.e., are greater than the upper bound of tolerable misstatement).
