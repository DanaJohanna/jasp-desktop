Efficiency technique: Separate known and unknown misstatement
==========================

In estimating the total misstatement in the population you are, in theory, dealing with known misstatement and unknown misstatement. The known misstatement comes from two possible sources. First, the misstatement found in any of the critical transactions. Second, the misstatement found the transactions in the sample. Using this method you separate the known and the unknown misstatement in the population, and extrapolate the uncertainty in your results over the unseen part of the part of the population alone. 

This technique will often result in a smaller sample size than is required if the technique is not applied.

**Note:** This technique requires the assumption that the sample taints are homogeneously distributed. You will need to test this in a post-hoc assumption check (available in the evaluation stage) that tests the correlation between the size of the taints and the size of the transaction. If this correlation does not exist, the use of this efficiency technique is justified. If this correlation is present, you cannot use this technique and will need to evaluate your sample using a different method.
